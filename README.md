# Decision_Trees_and_Random_Forests
This project trains Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on the Heart Disease dataset. It includes tree visualization with matplotlib, overfitting analysis via tree depth control, feature importance interpretation, accuracy comparison, and cross-validation evaluation for robust performance assessment.
Heart Disease Classification
Dataset: Heart Disease dataset with 1025 samples and 13 clinical features, plus target labels.

Purpose: To classify presence of heart disease using machine learning models.

Models Used:

Decision Tree (visualized with matplotlib, controlled depth).

Random Forest (comparative accuracy, feature importance).

Workflow:

Load dataset and prepare features.

Train decision tree and visualize its structure.

Analyze overfitting by testing various tree depths.

Train and evaluate random forest.

Compare accuracy and interpret feature importances.

Cross-validate models for reliable accuracy estimates.

Outputs:

Decision Tree visualization.

Accuracy comparison (~80% vs 98.5%).

Overfitting analysis graph.

Feature importance bar chart.

Cross-validation scores.

Usage:

Clone repo, install dependencies.

Run main script to execute the workflow.
